# osu-dual-state-mapper
A specialized key/button mapper for Osu! that treats press and release as separate held inputs. Map any key or mouse button to create unique play styles. Only activates in Osu!, features zero-delay processing and easy remapping.

## Why Use This?
Unlike regular key mappers that simply convert one key to another, this mapper:
- Treats every press AND release as a separate input
- Each input triggers and holds your chosen output key
- Only activates when Osu! is your active window
- Works with both keyboard and mouse buttons
- Zero input delay implementation

Example using Spaceâ†’Z mapping:
1. Press Space = Send and hold Z
2. Release Space = Send and hold a new Z
3. Each new action releases the previous hold
